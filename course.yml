title: An Introduction to Options Pricing
description: >-
  This course is an introduction to option markets and pricing models. Options
  markets are the epitome of global competitive economic processes. Options link
  many markets through the concept of arbitrage. They react to news at lightning
  speed as traders seek a competitive edge. Options provide a fascinating
  laboratory to understand the economics of information and uncertainty. In this
  course you will gain a basic understanding of what makes options so unique and
  interesting. We will use the R programming language to understand the payoffs
  of option trading strategies, to check market prices for arbitrage
  opportunities, and to implement two of the most famous theoretical options
  pricing models used every day by options traders; the Binomial and
  Black-Scholes models.
